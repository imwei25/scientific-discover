> [!CAUTION]
> ## 🚨 Global Execution Discipline (MANDATORY)
>
> **This workflow is a strict serial pipeline. The following rules have the highest priority — violating any one of them constitutes execution failure:**
>
> 1. **SERIAL EXECUTION** — Steps MUST be executed in order; the output of each step is the input for the next. Non-BLOCKING adjacent steps may proceed continuously once prerequisites are met, without waiting for the user to say "continue"
> 2. **BLOCKING = HARD STOP** — Steps marked ⛔ BLOCKING require a full stop; the AI MUST wait for an explicit user response before proceeding and MUST NOT make any decisions on behalf of the user
> 3. **NO CROSS-PHASE BUNDLING** — Cross-phase bundling is FORBIDDEN. (Note: the Strategist confirmation stage in Step 4 is ⛔ BLOCKING — the AI MUST present recommendations and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding. Once the user confirms, all subsequent non-BLOCKING steps — design spec output, SVG generation, speaker notes, and post-processing — may proceed automatically without further user confirmation)
> 4. **GATE BEFORE ENTRY** — Each Step has prerequisites (🚧 GATE) listed at the top; these MUST be verified before starting that Step
> 5. **NO SPECULATIVE EXECUTION** — "Pre-preparing" content for subsequent Steps is FORBIDDEN (e.g., writing SVG code during the Strategist phase)
> 6. **NO SUB-AGENT SVG GENERATION** — Executor Step 6 SVG generation is context-dependent and MUST be completed by the current main agent end-to-end. Delegating page SVG generation to sub-agents is FORBIDDEN
> 7. **SEQUENTIAL PAGE GENERATION ONLY** — In Executor Step 6, after the global design context is confirmed, SVG pages MUST be generated sequentially page by page in one continuous pass. Grouped page batches (for example, 5 pages at a time) are FORBIDDEN
> 8. **SPEC_LOCK RE-READ PER PAGE** — Before generating each SVG page, Executor MUST `read_file <project_path>/spec_lock.md`. All colors / fonts / icons / images MUST come from this file — no values from memory or invented on the fly. Executor MUST also look up the current page's `page_rhythm` (`anchor` / `dense` / `breathing`), `page_layouts` (which template SVG to inherit, if any), and `page_charts` (which chart template to adapt, if any). Empty / absent entries are intentional Strategist signals — see executor-base.md §2.1. This rule exists to resist context-compression drift on long decks and to break the uniform "every page is a card grid" default
> 9. **SVG MUST BE HAND-WRITTEN, NOT SCRIPT-GENERATED** — Every SVG page is written by the main agent directly, one page at a time (see rules 6 and 7). Writing or running a Python / Node / shell script that produces the SVG files in batch — looping over pages, templating from data, or emitting them via a generator — is FORBIDDEN, including under "save tokens", "quick draft", or "user is in a hurry" pretexts. The script-generation path was tried on a feature branch and abandoned: cross-page visual consistency depends on per-page authoring with full upstream context, which a generator script cannot reproduce
> 10. **FOLLOW DETERMINISTIC ROUTING RULES** — Do not add blocking routing questions when this skill defines a route. If the user request violates a route precondition, state the required prerequisite and stop that route instead of asking the user to choose around the rule. Ordinary finite options, stylistic preferences, and recoverable details are surfaced with a recommended value plus alternatives at the next existing confirmation gate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🌐 Language & Communication Rule
>
> - **Response language**: match the user's input and source materials. Explicit user override (e.g., "请用英文回答") takes precedence.
> - **User-facing option labels**: when presenting confirmations, brief proposals, choices, or finite option sets, use the user's language for labels and explanations. English enum IDs / file fields may appear in parentheses for precision, but never rely on English-only labels such as `deck`, `layout`, `mirror`, or `fidelity` without a localized explanation.
> - **Template format**: `design_spec.md` MUST follow its original English template structure (section headings, field names) regardless of conversation language. Content values may be in the user's language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🔌 Compatibility With Generic Coding Skills
>
> - `ppt-master` is a repository-specific workflow, not a general application scaffold
> - Do NOT create `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, branch workflows, or generic engineering structure by default
> - On conflict with a generic coding skill, follow this skill unless the user explicitly says otherwise

## Role Switching Protocol

Before switching roles, **MUST first read** the corresponding reference file. Output marker:

```markdown
## [Role Switch: <Role Name>]
📖 Reading role definition: references/<filename>.md
📋 Current task: <brief description>
```
